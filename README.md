# MqttTinyController for IoT Home Automation
MqttTinyController runs on Raspberry Pi PicoW (RP2040) using any free cloud MQTT broker (e.g. HiveHQ or Mosquitto) to control home automation relay switches and contact switches. It has capability to configure relay switches as momentary switches, offers hardware burnout protection, and enhances security through Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP). Supports JSON payload for free mobile app such as "IoT MQTT Panel".

# Project
Many of the MQTT PicoW codes, samples, and tutorials available on the Internet lack the robustness required to handle real-life disasters. They often fall short, either being overly simplistic or lacking essential features. This code is designed to meet the demands of DIY enthusiasts, it has undergone extensive testing to ensure reliability, it's stable to run 24/7 at home. 

It was originally based on umqtt.simple, umqtt.robust but both of the libraries FAILED so badly in my test cases, later during the development cycle, the code was re-written using "mqtt_as" library and asyncio library. The final product is capable of operating continuously without interruption, such as network interruption or SSID issues. In additional, in the face of potential threats such as hacking attempts targeting your MQTT client account to manipulate relay toggling, MqttTinyController protects the hackers from starting a fire in your home remotely.

# MqttTinyController Features
- Support relay switches (e.g. appliance control) and contact switches (e.g. magnetic contact)
- Capability to configure relay switches as momentary switches (e.g. garage doors with press/release functionality on remote control)
- Configurable momentary relay wait time, i.e. each relay can turn off after x seconds (e.g. turn on water solenoid valve on garden hose and turn off after x seconds. Use case: spray water at wild animal when detected by A.I.)
- Only one single MQTT Topic is needed for both publishers and subscribers with the use of JSON.
- Structure MQTT payload in JSON format to facilitate compatibility with mobile app "IoT MQTT Panel" leveraging JSON Path.
- Automatic WiFi reconnection functionality to seamlessly reconnect in case of disconnection. (Thanks to Peter Hinch on mqtt_as library)
- Automatic reconnection to the MQTT broker to maintain uninterrupted communication. (Thanks to Peter Hinch on mqtt_as library)
- Quality of Service (QoS) level 1 to guarantee no message loss even in the event of MQTT broker downtime or WiFi disconnection.
- Utilize the onboard LED to provide clear visual status indications: Operational, System halted or Connecting
- Implement hardware safeguards to prevent relay burnout caused by flooded incoming messages in a single batch, such as after WiFi reconnection. (Alternatively, you can use Peter Hinch's mqtt_as config["clean_init"])
- Integrate hardware safeguards to prevent relay burnout in scenarios of excessive toggling, automatically resuming operation after a predefined interval.
- Implement hardware safeguards to prevent message acceptance until a hardware reset if a predefined violation threshold is reached.
- Ensure data usage protection by halting MQTT message publishing in the event of a fatal error until a hardware reset is performed.
- Option to regularly publish hardware status to MQTT broker, broadcasting to all clients at predefined intervals for comprehensive monitoring and control.
- Retrieve statistics such as total uptime and outage occurrences.
- Obtain temperature readings using the onboard sensor of the Pico.
- Retrieve the public IP address of your router.
- Sync clock with NTP server for stats and MFA.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) with support for multiple keys for each GPIO. 
- Configure GPIO to send a JSON "NOTIFY" message when there is a real hardware change. This feature can be utilized by clients for notifications.


# Hardware
- Raspberry Pi PicoW Pre-Soldered Header (e.g. Freenove FNK0065C from Amazon)
- 4 or 8 Channel Relay Module (e.g. Sainsmart â€Ž101-70-101, 101-70-102 from Amazon)
- Pico Breakout Board (e.g. Freenove FNK0081 from Amazon)

# Does the code work on ESP32, ESP8266, Pyboard?
MqttTinyController was only tested on Raspberry PicoW. For some hardware calls, such as onboard LED and tempeature sensor, have been moved to mqtt_local.py (inherited from mqtt_as project). Minor code changes or implementation maybe needed to support other microcontrollers, it would be nice to abstract all the hardware calls to support all microcontrollers (contribution is welcome!). Other than that, I believe the rest of the code should be compatiable.

# DO NOT USE umqtt.simple/robust - memory leak 
Originally, this project relies on the "micropython-umqtt.simple" library for its operation. However, navigating through its various versions like "umqtt.simple", "umqtt.simple2", "umqtt.robust," or "umqtt.robust2" might lead to confusion. Unfortunately, all four libraries suffer from memory leaks or frozen issues. To illustrate, both "umqtt.simple" (with try/except reconnect) and "umqtt.robust" for auto-reconnect failed to pass my test cases on PicoW. While they managed to reconnect successfully, they persisted in experiencing memory leaks after several disconnect/reconnect cycles.  Eventually, it will lead to "out of memory" error:

       Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 47, in <module>
       OSError: [Errno 12] ENOMEM

or RTOS heap memory after reconnecting during SSL handshake

       Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 63, in <module>
       OSError: (-10368, 'MBEDTLS_ERR_X509_ALLOC_FAILED')

Although I was able to fix that, there were more problems on the test case 3:

- Case 1: Auto re-connect when network fails:  Use firewall rules on your router to block traffic to broker after connection is established 
- Case 2: Auto re-connect when Wifi fails (SSID is still available): Disconnect your PicoW using router admin
- Case 3: Auto re-connect when Wifi totally gone (SSID is NOT available): Power off the router or change the SSID name of WiFi

If you are using QoS1 on Case 3, the socket will hang indefinitely. However, if you are using QoS0, it is working fine but QoS1 cannot be used which defeats the purpose. The cause is the library uses blocking sockets with no timeout, Qos1 got stuck in wait_msg. It has been well documented in 2016:

- https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/issues/103 (Qos1 sock WiFi is degraded)
- https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/2568 (Mqtt Wifi dropped, timeout)

Solution: Use "mqtt_as" library written by Peter Hinch. It passed all the test cases with QoS1.

# Request/Response JSON is incompatible with Mobile app

You maybe wondering why are we sending e.g. {"GP1": 1, "GP2: 1} for both request and respond? Why can't we wrap the GPIO status like using "REQUEST" and "RESPONSE" keyword in JSON?
-        {"REQUEST": {"GP1": 1, "GP2": 1}}      # Note: This is for discussion only, not valid format
         {"RESPONSE": {"GP1": 0, "GP2": 0}}     # Note: This is for discussion only, not valid format
Indeed, this was implemented in v2.2.2. But the mobile app "IoT MQTT Panel" has a bug in JsonPath subscribe on the SWITCH. It doesn't toggle if the subscribe message has a different pattern than publish message.  This change was rolled back and the workaround was to add "UTC" timestamp on the Response message:
-        {"GP1": 0, "UTC": "2047-07-01 0:0:0"}
In the microcontroller, if callback sees the "UTC" key in the JSON message, it flags it as a response message and won't trigger any hardware change. This is very important for async calls where you want to set multiple GPIOs at once but individual relay turns off at different time (momentary relay).
  
# Mobile App "IoT MQTT Panel" Setup by Example

- GP16, GP17 are defined as Relay
- GP18, GP19 are defined as Momentary Relay
- GP0, GP1, GP2, GP3 are defined as Contact Switch
### Switch: (For Relay Switch) 
       Payload On: 1, Payload Off: 0
       "Payload is JSON Data" is Checked
       JsonPath for subscribe: $.GP16
       JSON pattern for publish: {"GP16": <payload>}
       Qos sets to 1
       Retain: unchecked
### Switch: (For Momentary Switch) 
       Exactly same as setting up Relay Switch, just replace GP16 with GP18
### LED Indicator: (For magentic contact)
       Payload On: 1,  Payload Off: 0
       "Payload is JSON Data" is Checked
       JsonPath for subscribe: $.GP1
       QoS sets to 1
### Button: (For Statistics)
       Name: Stats
       Payload: {"CMD":"stats"}
       Qos sets to 0
### Button: (For Getting IP address)
       Name: GetIP
       Payload: {"CMD":"getip"}
       Qos sets to 0
### Button: (For Refresh All GPIO)
       Name: Refresh All GPIO
       Payload: {"CMD":"refresh"}
       Qos sets to 0
### Text Log:
       Name: Log       
       QoS sets to 1
### Text Input:
       Name: MFA     
       Payload: {"MFA": <payload>}
       QoS sets to 1       
### LED Indicator: (For Notification on GP1)
       Name: NOTIFY GP1
       Payload On: 1  (or any value, doesn't matter)
       Payload Off: 0  (or any value, doesn't matter)
       Enable notification: Checked (Paid Pro version only)
       Matches with RegEx: selected
       RegEx: ^(?=.*\bNOTIFY\b)(?=.*\bGP1\b).*
       Message: Garage Door LEFT notification
       Payload Json: Unchecked 
       Note: "IoT MQTT Panel" has limitation on notification, it cannot trigger different message based on different value and
       it doesn't support JSON path on notification. See "Notification issue on Mobile app" section for details. 
       This is a workaround by creating an "LED Indicator" for custom message. 


# Can relay on/off be scheduled?
From a technical standpoint, it's possible to integrate the scheduling code into the microcontroller. However, I believe that scheduling shouldn't be its primary function. The microcontroller's main responsibility should revolve around hardware control and reporting hardware status through MQTT. For scheduling tasks, it should be triggered by the mobile app or other clients. One approach is to develop an Azure Function using MQTT NET or utilize Amazon AWS Lambda. This is a sample project I am running it on Azure which supports MFA (TOTP), it uses TimerTrigger with CRON expression:

https://github.com/DIY-able/MqttTimerFunction

Running Azure Function with such low volume doesn't cost a lot since the basic tier includes 1 million requests. With "Pay as you go" plan, all you need is to pay for Azure Blob Storage. Running a MQTT Timer function like this costs me around $0.02 US a day (or $0.6 US a month). 

# Notification issues on Mobile app
Similar to scheduling, notifications should not be the responsibility of the microcontroller. Many mobile MQTT apps include notification features, they keep a set of in-memory values. However, it is possible the app resets those values to default (such as NULL) caused by unknown reasons such as network interruption, it could result in FALSE POSITIVE notifications when "value is changed". To address this issue, MqttTinyController sends a JSON notification message to the MQTT broker, for example, {"NOTIFY": {"GP1", 1}} when there is a real hardware change on GP1. You can configure which GPIO has notifications enabled, see 'gpio_pins_for_notification' parameter in config file.  With this JSON response, you can enable notification (if your mobile app supports that) and send notification based on this JSON message/payload.

       notification_keyname = "NOTIFY"                 # Response in JSON, e.g. {"NOTIFY": {"GP16": 1, "GP17": 0}}
       gpio_pins_for_notification = {0, 1, 16, 17}     # Only send notification when GPIO values are changed

# Zero trust on MQTT broker, Mobile app or Azure
With high security in mind, we should never trust the free MQTT broker or mobile app. While HiveMQ clusters (free edition) provide usernames and passwords, the backend is shared. If someone obtains your MQTT username and password, or if HiveMQ is compromised, they can replay the message and easily open your garage door, for example by sending a {"GP18": 1}. To protect this, MqttTinyController introduced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP), you can use a secret key to generate a one time 6 digit code using Google Authenticator. Every time you want to change the relay on the microcontroller, just copy-paste and send the JSON message {"MFA": 123456} prior to the actual {"GPxx": 1} message. You can also configured how many expired codes it takes (see 'totp_max_expired_codes' in config). 

One GPIO pin takes multiple keys. For instance, GP16 controls my LED light, while GP18 operates my garage door. I have set up an Azure Function schedule to manage the switching of relay GP16 (LED light) daily using Secret_Key_B. When I access my mobile app, I utilize the TOTP generated by Secret_Key_A to interact with either GP16 (LED light) or GP18 (Garage door). The crucial point here is that even if someone were to breach my Azure account, obtain my MQTT broker username/password, and acquire Secret_Key_B from the configuration, attempting to open my garage door by sending {"GP18": 1} would result in a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) validation failure.


       totp_keyname = "MFA"                # Request command "MFA" is easier to type than "TOTP", e.g. {"MFA": 123456}
       totp_max_expired_codes = 5          #  Allow x number of expired code due to different clocks between devices
       
       gpio_pins_for_totp_enabled = {16: ["Secret_Key_A", "Secret_Key_B"],   # Notes: Keys have to be encoded in Base32
                                     18: ["Secret_Key_A"]

# Known MFA security issue
Because MqttTinyController does NOT validate client ID associated with TOTP secret keys. Also, GPIO action in payload is not tied to TOTP in a MQTT message. Therefore, it is possible for Client 1 to send MFA for GP18 (higher privileges) and within 30 seconds x 5 (expired passcode) = 2.5 min, Client 2 can turn on the relay by just sending {"GP18", 1} without sending MFA TOTP. In the existing implementation, the TOTP value is stored in a global variable on the microcontroller, it can be considered as a security risk within that 2.5 min. The reason it was implemented this way was because the "IoT MQTT Panel" mobile app cannot inject TOTP dynamcially as part of the Payload in the MQTT message, it would NOT be usable from UI prespective if you need to modify the payload for the switch everytime on the app. If mobile client supports dynamic TOTP, the MQTT message should look like this in the ideal world:

       {"GP16": 1, "GP17": 0, "MFA": 123456, "ClientID": "MobileApp1"}     # Note: This is for discussion, not valid format       

Then, microcontroller can validate the MFA value based on the Client's secret key. To get a balance between convenience and security and due to limitation of "IoT MQTT Panel" mobile app, we would leave it as it is now. The security risk is medium-low for home use. 

# Starting up with weak WIFI or power outage reboot
When you power up the PicoW without Wi-Fi or without a stable connection, the 'mqtt_as' module quits and shuts down. This behavior, as explained by Peter Hinch, is intentional. However, in cases of a power outage where both the Wi-Fi router and PicoW lose power simultaneously, upon restoration of power, the PicoW might start up before the Wi-Fi network is fully available, resulting in it being unable to function properly. To address this issue, a workaround is to implement a retry loop to attempt to connect to Wi-Fi a specified number of times (determined by the 'wifi_max_wait' parameter in the configuration) before initializing the 'mqtt_as' module.

# WPA3 issue and Flipper Zero attack
If you have enabled the "WPA2/WPA3" transition settings on your router, PicoW may experience connectivity issues if your device is not close to the router. Switching the settings back to "WPA2 only" resolves this issue, please keep this in mind.

When PicoW was running on WPA2, I tested with de-auth attack using Flipper Zero and Marauder, PicoW instantly got disconnected. When the de-auth attack was done, MqttTinyController automatically reconnected back to WIFI and MQTT broker flawlessly. Although PicoW wireless chip claims to support WPA3 but not sure if the driver supports that. If that's the case, you can technically run PicoW with WPA3 with Protected Management Frame (PMF) enabled on your router to prevent de-auth attack. But at this point, I am running it on WPA2 for stability.

# Important notes on QoS1 with Clear Session
In MQTT specification, there is "Clear Session" option, the code uses Quality of Service (QoS) level 1 with clear session disabled. All your messages have use QoS1 to send, with client "Clear Session" set to FALSE when subscribe to the MQTT broker. For mobile phone app "IoT MQTT Panel", you need to uncheck the "Clear Session" option in "Additional options". 
- If you have QoS1 enabled with "Clear Session" enabled. Whenever there is a connection lost, all messages during the black out time will be lost.
- If you have QoS1 enabled with "Clear Session" disabled. All your messages will show up after reconnection.

In "mqtt_as", there are 2 settings, i.e. config["clean"] and config["clearn_init"]. The intention is to prevent large backlog of qos==1 messages being received if outage is long.
However, in this application, config["clean"] is set to False and config["clearn_init"] is set to True. 

# Important notes on Retain flag
In MQTT specification, a message can be published to MQTT broker on a Topic with a Retain flag. Please do not enable this flag on the client. The retain message will cause confusion.  For mobile phone app "IoT MQTT Panel", uncheck the "Retain" checkbox next to QoS1 settings.

# Important notes on Client ID
If you have multiple clients connecting to MQTT broker with the same Client ID, unexpected behavior can happen. For example, you configured mobile app "IoT MQTT Panel" with clientID = "MyHomeClient" and PicoW is using the same clientID. Mobile app is able to publish the message, but PicoW subscription will fail on message call back. Please make sure each device or client have a unique ID.

# Known limitation
Consider GP26 and GP27 are defined as momentary relays with 10s and 2s wait time respectively:

       gpio_pins_for_momentary_relay_switch = {26:10, 27:2}
       
GP26 (+6V Relay) combined with GP27 (+9V DPDT) are configured to send +ve/-ve to open/close the water solenoid valve. Under normal situation, this will work perfectly:

       Request:  {"MFA":123456, "GP26":1, "GP27":1}
       GP26 +6V Relay   on ------------------------------ off (10s) 
       GP27 +9V DPDT    -- on ---------- off (2s)
       Result:  Solenoid valve opens and allows water to flow for 2 seconds and then turn off water

However, if there are multiple requests sending to the microcontroller before GP27 is finished, the solenoid value remain opens:

       Request:  {"MFA":123456, "GP26":1, "GP27":1}
       Request:  {"MFA":123456, "GP26":1, "GP27":1}
       GP26 +6V Relay   on ------------------------------ off (valve remain opens)
       GP27 +9V DPDT    -- on ---------- off
       GP26 +6V Relay                        on (failed because still running)
       GP27 +9V DPDT                         -- on ------------------- off
       Result:  Solenoid valve opens and allows water to flow and not able to turn off water

Because Microcontroller has no way to know GP26 and GP27 are depending on each other, they are both individual async call to turn on the hardware. We cannot simply reject 2nd connection of GP26 since we have no knowledge it is tied to GP27 even they are sending in one single JSON payload.

Workaround: If you are using Android App "Tasker" to trigger MQTT (either by Azure Function HTTP call or whatever way such as Tasker MQTT plugin), you can configure tasker by using the build-in variable %TIMES (unix timestamp) to prevent any 2nd attempt within 10 seconds (since we defined the GP26 is 10s delay). 

       Variable Set
       Name %LastRunTime To 0 
       If %LastRunTime !Set

       Variable Add
       Name %LastRunTime Value 10

       HTTP Request
       Method GET URL http://[your url with secret]
       If %TIMES > %LastRunTime

       Variable Set
       Name %LastRunTime To %TIMES
       
Unfortunately, this is not the best workaround unless we implement something to define the relationship between GP26 and GP27 and lock the GPIO change until both are finished.
